				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<h2><font size="4">History</h2>
				<h3><font size="2">Durham House of Pets was founded in 1983 when our owner Robert Jenkins was struggling to find quality pet supplies in the area! Born and raised in Arkansas, Rob had always had dogs in his life. Growing up in an animal family, Rob has had a passion for animals and their well-being his whole life, which helped shape his career path into Vet School. Doing his undergraduate studies at UNH Rob fell in love with the town of Durham. After finishing the Pre-Vet program, he made his way to the prestigious Veterinary Medicine program at Cornell. After graduating top of his class, Rob moved back to Durham where he has worked at his own veterinary practice Paw and Order: Special Vets Unit, a pun on his favorite TV Show. After setting up his practice, he noticed that a multitude of his customers or patients were becoming ill due to not having products available for all types of pets. Too often there were dogs and cats becoming ill from eating generic products rather than specialized products for the type of animal that they were. Vitamin deficiency was nearly his number one diagnosis and he wanted to reinvest in his community to try to fix this problem. In doing so, he founded his own store, Durham House of Pets. We started off as a pet food specialty store. Selling foods that would keep the number of admits to his clinic due to vitamin deficiency, salmonella, listeriosis, etc. to a minimum. Since, Durham House of Pets has expanded to a fully stocked pet superstore where we carry everything that your families beloved pets would need!
				<p>Our second store in Exeter, NH is now open! We found that some of our customers were traveling extreme distances to provide the care for their pets that we at Durham House of Pets believe should be a standard. Therefore, we opened a second store in Exeter, NH to provide for our patrons in that area. Based on the same values that we opened our original store; our second store carries the same products somewhere that we hope is closer to home for you!</p></h3>
				<h2><font size="4">Why use us?</h2>
				<h3><font size="2">As stated in the history section above, our owner Robert Jenkins has had a passion for animals and their well-being since his youth. We are proud of all of our products, and they are all products that all of our employees would use on their own pets. We aim to provide the best service for our clients. Not only are we a local small business, but we have experience as we have been operating in Durham since we opened in 1983, and our second store is based on the same values, where we started providing quality service for pets in early 2018. We only stock the best products to keep your beloved pets safe and as happy as can be.  The reason that we opened in the first place was that Rob wanted to save the families that were bringing their pets to us money on vet bills, when they could just buy the appropriate foods and other products that would keep their pets safe. Come on down today and see what we are all about!</h3>
